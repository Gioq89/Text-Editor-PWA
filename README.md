# Text-Editor-PWA

## Description
This challenge is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.. 

## Usage
To use this application, copy code to system and run npm install.
